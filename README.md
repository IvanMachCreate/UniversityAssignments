# Previous Assignments

As an exercise to familiarize using Github, I've uploaded all my old assignment files to GitHub. 

They have mostly shown my progress when it came learning about programming in C++, and grasping Object Oriented Programming. 

Granted, it is hard to distinguish my own work from the assignment given requirements. I admit I did not put much forthought into this task, given the storage of these files is an exercise to Github workflow.
